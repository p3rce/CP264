Remember the final exam of CP264 for the Spring semester of 2020 is on
Wednesday June 24, 2020
It will be a two-hour exam between 11:30 to 1:30 pm.
However, the exam will be available from 11:30 to 2:30 pm.
It is a take-home exam where you can use your notes and assignments.
Collaboration during the exam, physically or virtually, is an academic offence which comes with serious consequences.
I wish you all good luck
